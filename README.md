In order to facilitate reproducible research of this work, this repository includes all R codes and associated input data that were used to construct the CSAR models, Figures and Tables.

Contents in this repository includes the following:
1. **Descriptors** (*the computed descriptors of compounds investigated in this study*)
2. **Figure_X** (*X denote the Figure numbers; these folders contain all codes, associated data and OmniGraffle files that were used to produce the Figures*)
3. **Supplementary_anti-sickling_agents.csv** (*the data set of anti-sickling agents used in this study; this CSV file includes the SMILES notation and their associated biological activity*)
4. **Supplementary_Fig_1_to_6.pdf** (*Supplementary Figures 1 to 6*)
5. **Table_2_CSAR_model** (*all R codes and fingerprint CSV files that were used to construct the CSAR models are provided within this folder*)
